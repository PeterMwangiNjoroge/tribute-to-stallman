<p class="list-group-item"><i>Early Life <br> Born on March 16, 1953 (age 63) to Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman, a printing press broker, in New York City. He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094. From 1967 to 1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University Saturday program for high school students.</p>
<p class="list-group-item"><i>Harvard University and MIT</i><br>
As a first-year student at Harvard University in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in Math . He was happy: "For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard."
In 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and became a regular in the hacker community, where he was usually known by his initials, RMS (which was the name of his computer accounts).Stallman graduated from Harvard earning a bachelor's degree in Physics in 1974.</p>
<p class="list-group-item"><i>GNU project and FSF</i><br>
Stallman announced the plan for the GNU operating system in September 1983 on several ARPANET mailing lists and USENET.In February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the GNU project, which he had announced in September 1983.In 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix.The name GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix."Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="list-group-item"><i>Activism</i><br>
Stallman has written many essays on software freedom, and has been an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement since the early 1990s.The speeches he has regularly given are titled The GNU Project and the Free Software Movement, The Dangers of Software Patents, and Copyright and Community in the Age of Computer Networks.In 2006 and 2007, during the eighteen month public consultation for the drafting of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, he added a fourth topic explaining the proposed changes.
Stallman is a world traveler and has visited at least 65 countries, mostly to speak about free software and the GNU project. 
In Venezuela, Stallman has delivered public speeches and promoted the adoption of free software in the state's oil company (PDVSA), in municipal government, and in the nation's military. 
In August 2006, at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of Kerala, he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft's, at state-run schools. This has resulted in a landmark decision to switch all school computers in 12,500 high schools from Windows to a free software operating system.
